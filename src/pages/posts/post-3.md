It wasn't always smooth sailing, but I'm enjoying building with Astro. And, the [Discord community](https://astro.build/chat) is friendly and helpful!

 This is a fake post from the tutorial. I'll replace it in the future with my own content. If you see this, find me on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/fellaroonie.bsky.social) and tell me about!
