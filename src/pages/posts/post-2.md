After a successful first week learning Astro, I decided to try some more. I wrote and imported a small component from memory!

This is a fake post from the tutorial. I'll replace it in the future with my own content. If you see this, find me on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/fellaroonie.bsky.social) and tell me about!
